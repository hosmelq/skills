# tests/ArchitectureTest.php

## Purpose

This reference defines conventions for `tests/ArchitectureTest.php`.

## When To Use

Use this reference when your task matches this path and you need to follow its local conventions.

## Required Pattern

Use architecture tests for repository-wide static expectations, not for normal behavioral coverage.

### Existing Rules

- PHP preset is enabled.
- Laravel preset is enabled with explicit local exceptions.
- Security preset is enabled with local exceptions.
- The `App` namespace must use strict types.

### Example

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use App\Providers\ExampleServiceProvider;

arch()->preset()->php();

arch()->preset()->laravel()->ignoring([
    'App\Support\ExampleMetadata',
    ExampleServiceProvider::class,
]);

arch()->preset()->security()->ignoring('assert');

arch('strict types')
    ->expect('App')
    ->toUseStrictTypes();
```

### When To Add Or Edit

Add architecture coverage only when introducing a rule that should apply broadly across namespaces, for example:

- all application classes should use strict types;
- a namespace should not depend on another namespace;
- a class category should implement a framework contract;
- a prohibited function or pattern should not appear in production code.

### What Not To Put Here

- Do not assert resource JSON shapes here.
- Do not assert route behavior here.
- Do not assert model relationships here.
- Do not use architecture tests as a substitute for Unit, Integration, or Feature tests.

If a rule needs fixtures, database state, HTTP, or factories, it belongs in another suite.

## Coverage Expectations

Read the live architecture file and the namespaces affected by the proposed
rule. Add only repository-wide static contracts with intentional exceptions.

## Do Not

- Do not contradict the skill non-negotiables or project conventions.
