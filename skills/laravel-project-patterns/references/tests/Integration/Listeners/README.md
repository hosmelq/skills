# tests/Integration/Listeners

## Purpose

This reference defines conventions for integration tests under `tests/Integration/Listeners`.

## When To Use

Use this reference when your task matches this path and you need to follow its local conventions.

## Required Pattern

Use `tests/Integration/Listeners/<Listener>Test.php` for event/listener behavior that depends on model events, media events, persistence, or framework integration.

### File Shape

- Create the minimum persisted model that triggers the listener. Use the generic support model from `tests/Support/Models` for package listeners when no application model owns the behavior.
- Use fakes for files, storage, media, notifications, or HTTP as needed.
- Assert the persisted side effect on the model, media record, custom property, database, or dispatched output.

### Media Listener Pattern

For media listeners:

- use `UploadedFile::fake()->image(...)`;
- attach media through the model API that triggers the package event;
- assert custom properties or generated metadata on the returned media instance;
- include a negative test for unsupported mime types or unsupported conditions.

```php
it('only runs for supported mime types', function (): void {
    $model = ExampleModel::query()->create();

    $media = $model->addMedia(UploadedFile::fake()->image('image.gif'))
        ->toMediaCollection();

    expect($media)
        ->getCustomProperty('height')->toBeNull()
        ->getCustomProperty('width')->toBeNull();
});

it('saves generated metadata for supported images', function (): void {
    $model = ExampleModel::query()->create();

    $media = $model->addMedia(UploadedFile::fake()->image('image.jpg', 200, 200))
        ->toMediaCollection();

    expect($media)
        ->getCustomProperty('height')->toBe(200)
        ->getCustomProperty('width')->toBe(200);
});
```

## Coverage Expectations

Cover both:

- the listener runs and writes the expected side effect;
- the listener does not run for unsupported input.

Do not call listener internals directly when a package or framework event path is the behavior being protected.
Listeners use narrower coverage wording because the protected behavior is the
event path. Read the live listener and tests for the same event and observable
side effect; do not add symmetry cases the listener does not own.

## Do Not

- Do not contradict the skill non-negotiables or project conventions.
