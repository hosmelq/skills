# app/Notifications

## Purpose

This reference defines conventions for notifications under `app/Notifications`.

## When To Use

Use this reference when your task matches this path and you need to follow its local conventions.

## Required Pattern

Use `app/Notifications` for queued recipient-facing notifications sent by actions or session flows.

### Notification Shape

- Extend `Notification` and implement `ShouldQueue` when the notification is recipient-facing mail.
- Use `Queueable`.
- Use constructor property promotion for notification data.
- Keep channel selection in `via(): array`.
- Keep message rendering in the notification method such as `toMail(...)`.
- Keep mail subjects, greetings, and body lines literal unless a sibling notification already localizes them.

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Notifications;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\MailMessage;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;

class ExampleCodeNotification extends Notification implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Queueable;

    public function __construct(public readonly ExampleCode $code)
    {
    }

    public function toMail(): MailMessage
    {
        return new MailMessage()
            ->subject('Your verification code')
            ->greeting('Here is your verification code')
            ->line('Use this code to continue: '.$this->code->value)
            ->line("If you didn't request this, you can ignore this message.");
    }

    /**
     * @return array<int, string>
     */
    public function via(): array
    {
        return ['mail'];
    }
}
```

### Tests

- Notifications are usually asserted through the action or controller that sends them.
- Use notification fakes and assert the notifiable route/data that matters.
- When a controller endpoint delegates notification payload generation to an action, mock that action in the controller feature test and return a persisted payload model. Leave payload persistence, cleanup, retry, and max-attempt behavior to `tests/Integration/Actions`.
- Add direct notification assertions only when the message structure itself changes.

```php
Notification::fake();

$code = ExampleCode::factory()->createOne([
    'recipient' => 'actor@example.com',
    'value' => '111111',
]);

$this->mock(GenerateExampleCode::class, function (MockInterface $mock) use ($code): void {
    $mock->shouldReceive('handle')
        ->once()
        ->with('actor@example.com')
        ->andReturn($code);
});

$response = postJson(route('api.sessions.code.request'), [
    'recipient' => 'actor@example.com',
]);

$response->assertOk();

Notification::assertSentOnDemand(
    ExampleCodeNotification::class,
    function (
        ExampleCodeNotification $notification,
        array $channels,
        AnonymousNotifiable $notifiable
    ) use ($code): bool {
        return ($notifiable->routes['mail'] ?? null) === $code->recipient
            && $notification->code->is($code);
    }
);
```

## Coverage Expectations

Read the live notification and siblings using the same channel and dispatch
boundary. Cover the sender unless message rendering itself changes.

## Do Not

- Do not contradict the skill non-negotiables or project conventions.
